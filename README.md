# Salem Version 3

Third Revision of Salem, Capacitive Proximity Sensor.

---

### Salem was originally designed as a REM Pod competitor. A conscience and lack of follow-though drove me to release the project, for the betterment of *Parapsychology Research*.

(Plus I didn't feel like dealing with *FCC Regulatory Compliance*.... or shipping logistics, customers, pricing, manufacturing, overhead... )

Effective range, depending on placement can vary from 6-10 inches. This is a ballpark estimate from lab testing. I have not had time to carry out a conclusive test to gauge the effective sensing range.

### Info

This project is a battery powered capacitive proximity sensor. Some folks believe a device like this will detect paranormal apparitions. **I can not confirm or deny the existence of ghosts. I am also not claiming this device will detect paranormal apparitions, this includes but is not limited too.**

- The Jersey Devil
- The Headless Body of Spiro Agnew
- Ghost
- Demons / Angles
- Batman
- Karma
- UFO's / USO's
- The Chupacabra
- Vampires
- Witches / Wizards
- The SOB that ate my Twix
- Bigfoot / Yeti's
- Tom Cruise
- Most Breads of Cats.
- Bloody Mary
- Unicorns
- Other Benign and Nefarious Mythical Creatures


However devices like this do exist on the market, and consumers use them in an effort to detect the "paranormal".

In full transparency, both the hardware and firmware are included in this repo. Should an individual wish to understand the operation of this device and similar devices, all necessary information is provided.

**I offer no support for this device, it has become a leisurely project.**
